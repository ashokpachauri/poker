YOU NEED ROOT ACCESS TO YOUR SSH TERMINAL!

# Allow public access to port 3000 (or any other port number to your liking). Talk to your hosting provider, they can do it for you.

# Login to your terminal as root and run the following command in terminal, replace {USERNAME} with your cPanel username, {DOMAIN} with your domain:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/{USERNAME}/{DOMAIN}
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/{USERNAME}/{DOMAIN}
sudo touch /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/{USERNAME}/{DOMAIN}/proxy_pass.conf
sudo touch /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/{USERNAME}/{DOMAIN}/proxy_pass.conf

Open the above 2 files using nano (sudo nano FILE_PATH) or any editor of your choice and add the following lines, replace 3000 with your choice of port:

ProxyPass /.well-known !
ProxyPass /ws ws://{DOMAIN}:3000
ProxyPassReverse /ws ws://{DOMAIN}:3000

Save the file. If you are using nano editor, press Ctrl + X, then press Y and Enter/Return.

Rebuild settings and restart the services using the following commands:

/scripts/rebuildhttpdconf
service httpd restart

Done!
Now login as admin to your poker installation, go to settings and set the WebSocket address to: wss://{DOMAIN}/ws
And set the port number to your port of choice.

Finally, go to terminal again and run the following command, {PATH} is your poker installation absolute path, for example: /home/{USERNAME}/public_html

cd {PATH}

If you aree testing, for example in a development server. Run this command:

php server.php

Or if you want to keep the websocket server live at all times, which you would want in a production server. Run this command:

nohup php server.php

WebSocket server is now live and gameplay should work.
